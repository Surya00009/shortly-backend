Shortly is a secure full-stack URL management platform built using **Java, Spring Boot, Spring Security, JWT, Hibernate, MySQL, and React**. It enables authenticated users to create, manage, and analyze shortened URLs through a secure dashboard.

The backend follows a layered architecture with secure JWT-based authentication, RESTful APIs, and MySQL database integration, while the React frontend provides an intuitive interface for URL management and analytics.

# 🏗 Architecture

The application follows a layered architecture to ensure separation of concerns, maintainability, and scalability.

```
                    React Frontend
                           │
                     Axios HTTP Client
                           │
                    Spring Boot Backend
                           │
                   Spring Security (JWT)
                           │
                     REST Controllers
                           │
                    Service Layer
                           │
                 Spring Data JPA Repository
                           │
                        Hibernate
                           │
                         MySQL
```

## Request Flow

1. The user interacts with the React frontend.
2. Axios sends HTTP requests to the Spring Boot REST APIs.
3. Spring Security validates the JWT token and authorizes the request.
4. Controllers receive the request and delegate business logic to the Service layer.
5. The Service layer processes the request and interacts with the Repository layer.
6. Spring Data JPA and Hibernate perform database operations on MySQL.
7. The processed response is returned to the frontend as JSON.

## Architecture Highlights

- Layered Architecture (Controller → Service → Repository)
- DTO-based request and response handling
- JWT-based Authentication and Authorization
- RESTful API Communication
- Spring Data JPA with Hibernate ORM
- Centralized Exception Handling
- Input Validation for API Requests

# 🗄 Database Design

The application uses **MySQL** as the relational database to store user information, shortened URLs, and click analytics.

## Entity Relationship

```text
User (1)
   │
   └──────────────► Link (Many)
                         │
                         └────────────► ClickAnalytics (Many)
```

---

## User

| Column | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `id` | Unique identifier for the user |
| `full_name` | User's full name |
| `email` | User email address |
| `password` | Encrypted password using BCrypt |

---

## Link

| Column | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `id` | Unique identifier for the shortened link |
| `original_url` | Original URL provided by the user |
| `short_code` | Generated unique short code |
| `click_count` | Total number of clicks |
| `created_at` | Link creation timestamp |
| `last_accessed` | Most recent access timestamp |
| `user_id` | Foreign key referencing the owner of the link |

---

## ClickAnalytics

| Column | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `id` | Unique identifier |
| `clicked_at` | Timestamp of the click event |
| `link_id` | Foreign key referencing the associated link |

---

## Relationships

- One **User** can create multiple shortened links.
- Each **Link** belongs to exactly one user.
- Each **Link** can have multiple click analytics records.
- Click analytics data is used to generate dashboard statistics and track URL performance.
